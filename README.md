# Flightle
A mini-game that quizzes you on the optimal route between two airports via connecting flights, e.g. LGW (London Gatwick Airport) -> KHS (Khasab Airport, Oman) would require min 2 stops in Dubai + Muscat. Took up this project to primarily learn SVG manipulation. Currently in development but faces issues with licensing.
